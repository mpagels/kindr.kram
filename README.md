kindr.kram helps you keeping track of the money your relatives have donated to your baby wish list.

## About

My wife and I expecting our first child. Since we announced the pregnancy our parents are going crazy and want give us money for buying all the expensive stuff for her first grandchild :-). I recently switch careers and become a web dev and always looking for new app ideas I can code, decided to build a app, where our parents and grandparents can donate money to the "stuff" we want to buy. I really like the idea to keep them involved in the process than just simple give money away.
I loved discussing with my wife about features and how much she was commited to the project. ‚ù§

This project can easily be converted in some sort of "support" app. Just add a wish or a product and let your friends or family donate to the items. Maybe change the logo at the login page ;-)

I learned a lot at building the app. Authentication took much longer than expected and stills feels a bit hacky implementend ;-) I looked into `passport.js` but decided to go with a self implemented jwt approach.

On the way I learned a lot about React `Context` and currently I'm looking into `redux` to get a better feeling, when to use which tool.
