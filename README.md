kindr.kram helps you keeping track of the money your relatives have donated to your baby wish list.

My wife and I expecting our first child. Since we announced the pregnancy our parents are going crazy and want give us money for buying all the expensive stuff for her first grandchild :-). I recently switch careers and become a web dev and always looking for new app ideas I can code, decided to build a app, where our parents and grandparents can donate money to the "stuff" we want to buy. I really like the idea to keep them involved in the process than just simple give money away.

I learned a lot at building the app. Authentication took much longer than expected and stills feels a bit hacky implementend ;-)
I loved discussing with my wife about features and how much she was commited to the project. ❤
