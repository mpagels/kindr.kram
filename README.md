# kindr.kram

> what means kindr.kram ;-)

kindr.kram helps you keeping track of the money your relatives have donated to your baby wish list.

My wife and I expecting our first child. Since we announced the pregnancy our parents are going crazy and want give us money for buying all the expensive stuff for her first grandchild :-). I recently switch careers and become a web dev and always looking for new app ideas I can code, decided to build a app, where our parents and grandparents can donate money to the "stuff" we want to buy. I really like the idea to keep them involved in the process than just simple give money away.

I learned a lot at building the app. Authentication took much longer than expected and stills feels a bit hacky implementend ;-)
I loved discussing with my wife about features and how much she was commited to the project. ❤

## Build with

- React
- Express.js
- MongoDB & mongoose
- jwt auth
- styled-components
- Cloudinary

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

In order to run the app you need on your local machine you need

- a Mongo DB (local or in the cloud doesn't matter)
- a free cloudinary account (for picture upload)

## Installation

- clone the project
- `cd` in the root directory and hit `npm install`
- you nee

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
